    <p>THE NEW TIME TIMES----------------December 26, 2019</p>
    <p>BREAKING NEWS</p>
    <p>A man named Jake Jacobs was found dead near an underpass late last night. The cause of death appears to have been
    a hit and run but some details don't seem to corroborate this story. Witnesses say the man just vanished out of thin air 
    and just appeared the next morning dead on the side of the street. The body recovered also seems to have markings of 
    what sems to indicate that he was attacked by some sort of animal.</p>
    <p>This news comes only days after another anomaly where an eight year old girl named Samantha Gibbins seemingly disappeared while 
    coming home from a night out with her mother. Her body, just as mysteriously, reappeared where she first disappeared.
    She was found with similar markings to those found on the recently deceased Jake Jacobs. All we can do now, is hope
    that they are in a better plac.</p>
