Final Project

I created the website which holds my profile picture, as well as a brief introduction to myself. 
The page created when the app.py file is first run is the main page which serves as a hub to 
all of the available functions. I added a link to my favorite website which is a guide to New
York City attractions, travel, eateries, etc. There is also a website to an interactive game I 
developed as well as two buttons that lead to the optional portion of the assignment that describe
all of the assignments in the course and the classes I have taken so far at Columbia.
